  <h1>Short Intros</h1>
  <p class="font-small">Your name, a little bit about yourself (maybe favorite video game or movie or something else), and what you hope to learn.</p>
  <p class="font-small">My name is Chris, and I work at <a href="https://www.paviliongift.com/" target="_blank">Pavilion</a>. I love Zelda, Mario Karts, Black Ops 2 Zombies, and Warcraft 3.  Making websites is one of my favorite activities.</p>

<section class="slide hidden-slide">
  <p class="font-large">What is</p>
  <h1>Web Development?</h1>
  <p class="font-small">It's the process of coding a website, using 3 main languages: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript6.  It can also mean designing the layout and style of the site.  There are also people who design and code the interactive elements of a site, known as UI & UX.  You can also be the manager of the development team.  We will learn the basics of some of these concepts.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide hidden-slide">
  <p class="font-large">There are 2 main developers:</p>
  <h1>Back & Front end</h1>
  <p class="font-small">Back end, aka server side, can use many different programming languages (Ruby, Java, Python, PHP, C#, and JavaScript to name some popular languages). This is the behind-the-scenes part of a website, and we won't discuss it that much.</p>
  <p class="font-small">We will be concerned with front end, aka client side.  This is the part that the user sees and interacts with.  It can be a broad set of disciplines: coding, layouts, designs, user interfaces, and user experiences.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide hidden-slide">
  <p class="font-large">We will start with...</p>
  <h1>HTML</h1>
  <p class="font-small">It stands for HyperText Markup Language, and the current version is 5.  It's the foundation or format behind essentially every site.  It was developed in the 80s and it was first introduced in 1993.</p>
  <p class="font-small">It is probably the easiest part to learn.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide hidden-slide">
  <p class="font-large">Next on to...</p>
  <h1>CSS</h1>
  <p class="font-small">It stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and the current version is 3.  CSS has a wide array of abilities, but it is mainly the style of a site.  It was developed in the 90s and it was first introduced in 1996.</p>
  <p class="font-small">It has more concepts than HTML, so it can be more difficult.</p>
</section>
<section class="slide hidden-slide">
  <p class="font-large">Lastly we have...</p>
  <h1>JavaScript</h1>
  <p class="font-small">It doesn't have a fancy meaning, and the current version is 6 (released last month so we will use 5).  JS is a true programming language, so it can control a lot of different things such as: user interactions, saving things in a form, animation, drawing, math, and so much more.</p>
  <p class="font-small">There are many concepts to explain, so JS is the most difficult.  It can also do a ton of cool stuff!</p>
</section>
  <section class="slide hidden-slide">
  <p class="font-large">So let's...</p>
  <h1>Jump in & have fun!</h1>
  <p class="font-small">This class is all about making something cool. Asking questions and bringing up ideas is important. We are now all one team.</p>
  <p class="font-small">Hopefully by the end you will have the skills to build your own site, app, game, etc.  It can be any topic you want!</p>
